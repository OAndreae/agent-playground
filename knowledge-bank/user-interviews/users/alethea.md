- Previously spent around two hours preparing questions using Word, drawing from internal records, notes, bios and personal knowledge, sometimes delegating initial question drafting to assistant. [Link to context](#traditional-preparation-process)
- Wanted to reduce preparation time and was attracted to trying something new that could streamline the process. [Link to context](#original-objectives-for-using-the-app)

## Key Problems and Pain Points

### Preparation Time and Effort
- Historically spends several hours preparing interview questions for each quarterly townhall.
- Process involves extensive research through internal records, notes, and biographical information.
- Often delegates initial question drafting to assistant, then reviews and refines.

### Manual Question Creation
- Adding quickfire questions manually is particularly painful.
- Needs questions that provide insight into the interviewee's life and personality whilst gently easing both the interviewee and audience into the main discussion.
- Organising questions in Word lacks structure and automation.

### Script Completeness
- Requires a complete script including introduction, key-point summary, main questions with segues, and closing remarks.
- Previously had to manually create all these elements separately.

## Feature Requests and Improvement Suggestions

### High Priority
1. **Automatic quickfire question generation**: Feature to automatically generate personality-revealing icebreaker questions that ease people into the main interview.
2. **Copy to clipboard button**: Currently requires manual text highlighting and Ctrl+C to copy generated content.
3. **Complete script generation**: Generate entire interview script including:
   - Introduction section
   - Key-point summary to start with
   - Main questions with suggested segues between them
   - Closing remarks section

## What Works Well

- Clean, simple UX that's easy to navigate.
- Core question generation functionality works reliably.
- Submit workflow is straightforward and intuitive.
- App successfully generates useful interview questions.

## Objectives and Success Criteria

**Success Metrics**:
- App generates complete interview script (introduction, questions with segues, closing remarks).
- Automatic generation of quickfire personality questions.
