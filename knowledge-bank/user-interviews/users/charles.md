- Preparation process involves identifying discussion objectives, reviewing
  internal biographies, asking leaders what they'd like to discuss, and
  researching their initiatives, background (education and career), and any
  contrary views or strong opinions [link](#preparation-process-for-interviews)
- Preparation typically takes a few hours, with the most time-consuming aspect
  being thinking of meaningful questions and structuring them to flow seamlessly

- Experienced a specific interview where the leader commented that questions
  were "jumping around quite a lot" despite Charles having lots of detailed
  information [link](#recent-interview-experience-where-flow-didnt-work-well)
- Desires to plan a narrative from beginning to end, finishing with drawing out
  advice from the leader

- Typically spends half an hour on the interview itself, whilst researching and
  thinking of questions takes significantly longer
