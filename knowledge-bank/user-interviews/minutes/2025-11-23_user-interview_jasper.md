### Research and preparation process

**Could you walk me through your typical preparation process before interviewing
someone? Start from when you first learn who your guest will be.**

**Follow-up probes:**

- What specific sources do you check first?
- How long does this process typically take?
- What does your final question list look like - fully scripted or bullet
  points?

**Notes:**\
Deep dive into their background, read recent work and public interviews and
anything to craft thoughtful interviews.

Crafts thoughtful questions.

Starts with quick overview of professional background = LinkedIn, recent
interviews, social media interviews they've discussed.

Time:

- depends on guest and how familiar he is with their work
- A few hours to days
- A few hours to write questions

Resources:

- professional networking sites like LinkedIn to understand career path
- news profiles and public interviews
- Social media to understand who they are and recent thoughts
- Internal past interviews

Scripts:

- bullet points and key questions
- sometimes jot down a few follow-up ideas or interesting angles
- Concise and flexible

### Pain points in preparation

**Within that preparation process, what's the most time-consuming or frustrating
part?**

**Follow-up probes:**

- Can you give me a specific example of when this happened recently?
- How does this friction actually show up in your workflow?
- How often does this come up?
- What workarounds have you developed to deal with this?

**Notes:** Most time consuming is digging through lots of info to find most
relevant and up-to-date details can be difficult to find especially unique
angles

Recent example:

- one guest had a broad portfolio of work across many industries
- Difficult to find that information

Friction/difficult:

- guest had contributed to a wide range of fields
- difficult to decide what to ask about

Doesn't come up that much Fairly straightforward to find

Workarounds:

- focus on the guest's most recent and impactful contributions
- contact the guest directly on what they think is most important to them

Magic wand:

- supersmart ai tool that can sift through info, highlight most relevant,
  suggest angles and questions

### Conducting the interview

**When you're actually in the interview - on the call with your guest - what's
your primary focus? How do you balance following your prepared questions with
staying present in the conversation?**

**Follow-up probes:**

- Do you stick mostly to prepared questions or blend in unexpected ones?
- What signals tell you whether to dig deeper or move on?
- Tell me about a time when you got stuck or felt uncertain during an interview.
- How do you handle it when the conversation goes off-track?

**Notes:** In interview:

- focussed on being present and listening carefully to guest
- keep in mind questions and structure
- like to be adaptable

balance:

- keep the conversation engaging and natural
- responding authentically
- keeping eye on time and overall flow

Blends prepared and unexpected questions:

- sometimes best insights come from off-script

Signals:

- cues like tone of voice
- if audience finds topic interesting

Stuck or uncertain:

- sometimes happens time-to-time
- answer leads in a different direction

Off-track:

- pause and listen to what the guest is saying
- find thread or point of connection to steer back on track
- keep conversation organic

### Post-production workflow

**After the interview is recorded, what happens next? Walk me through the
post-production process.**

**Follow-up probes:**

- Who's involved at each stage?
- What does the editing team need from you?
- How do you ensure the final video aligns with your vision from the interview?
- What takes the longest in this phase?

**Notes:** Review footage, then work with editing team to refine video and add
graphics, ensure editing is clear, review to align with branding and messaging.

Editing process details:

- trim unneeded parts
- smooth flow
- visuals
- tweak audio
- intro and outro elements

Approvals and reviews:

- getting initial cut review with stakeholders
- few rounds of feedback to adjust tone or feedback
- compliance checks

Timeline:

- Process takes 1-2 weeks total
- Editing takes 1-2 days
- Approval and compliance take more time (appears to be the bottleneck)

### Panel interview process and challenges

**You mentioned panel interviews - can you tell me about your experience running
those? How does the process differ from your one-on-one Fireside chats?**

**Follow-up probes:**

- What's involved in the coordination phase?
- What specific challenges do you run into?
- Can you walk me through a recent example?

**Notes:** Preparation is more involved. Need to coordinate with multiple
panellists. They must be aligned with topics. Need to ensure everyone gets
chance to speak. Follow-up is more collaborative.

Focus on having chance the panellists can weigh in. No one is overbearing.

Key differences - First step is coordination. Brief meeting or exchange
messages. Gather everyone's input on questions. Keep track of who's asking what
during the interview. Gather feedback after for everyone.

Challenges:

- Making sure that the conversation stays balanced.
- Keeping track of the flow - conversation doesn't feel too fragmented.
- Coordination beforehand so everyone is on the same page.
- Dynamics can be unpredictable - panellists can have different opinions or jump
  in at same time.

### Handling real-time panel dynamics

**What do you actually do when panellists jump in at the same time or start
disagreeing during the interview? Can you give me a specific example?**

**Follow-up probes:**

- Walk me through exactly what happened in that situation.
- What words did you use or what did you do to manage it?
- Did it work, or did you feel like it could have gone better?
- How often does this happen, and does it affect the final interview?

**Notes:** Remain calm and balanced. acknowledge the value of both perspectives.
tries to ensure that everyone feels heard.
