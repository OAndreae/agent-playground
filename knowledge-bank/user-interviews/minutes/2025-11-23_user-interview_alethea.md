# Interview with Alethea - 2025-11-23

### Townhall Interview Context

**Can you walk me through what a typical quarterly townhall looks like, and specifically your role in interviewing senior leaders during these events?**

Follow-up probes:
- How much advance notice do you typically receive before a townhall?
- What format do these interviews usually take (one-on-one, panel, audience Q&A)?
- How long do these interview sessions typically last?
- Who is the audience for these townhalls?

**Notes:**
Normally a set-piece event. She could handle a panel dicussion or 1:1 fireside chat. Recently interviewed the CEO about his new strategy. Lots of advance notice - typically a few weeks. Interivew sessions are normally 30 minutes. Audience comprises all internal employees.

### Traditional Preparation Process

**Before you had access to this app, how would you normally prepare for interviewing a senior leader at a townhall?**

Follow-up probes:
- Can you describe a specific recent example of how you prepared for one of these interviews?
- What sources of information would you typically draw from when crafting your questions?
- How much time would you typically spend on preparation?
- What tools or methods did you use to organise and structure your questions?

**Notes:**
Normally, she'd do lots of research around what they've been doing - using internal records and notes. There's normally an agenda of points they want to put across which Alethea knows about and facilitates. Uses internal bios and own knowledge from conversations. Spends a couple of hours or delegates to assistant before reviewing the questions. Organised in Word.

### Original Objectives for Using the App

**What prompted you to try using this app for the townhall, and what specific outcomes were you hoping to achieve?**

Follow-up probes:
- Were there particular pain points in your usual process that you hoped the app would address?
- Did you have specific concerns or uncertainties about using it before the event?
- What would have constituted "success" for using the app during that townhall?
- Were there any stakeholders (beyond yourself) who had expectations about using the app?

**Notes:**
Lots of things. Wanted to try something new. Took lots of time to prepare for them and thought it sounded like the app could help. Success is being able to have the app generate the entire script for me with suggested segues between questions. Also include an introduction/key-point summary to start with. There should be a closing remarks section. I had to add the quickfire questions manually - these are such a pain to add as I need questions that give an insight into the person's life/personality and gently ease them and the audience into the main questions. I wish there was feature to do this for me. No other stakeholder so far - hasn't show it to anyone.

### Preparation Experience with the App

**Tell me about your experience using the app to prepare for the townhall interview. How did that process unfold?**

Follow-up probes:
- At what point did you start using the app relative to the townhall date?
- Can you walk me through the specific steps you took within the app?
- How did the app's approach to question generation differ from what you would have done manually?
- Were there moments of confusion or friction during the preparation phase?

**Notes:**
Clean UX. Nice and simple. Used it about a week before so I had time to prepare manually if it didn't work. Added relevant details and then clicked submit. All worked really well. Would be nice if there was a button to copy the text automatically though - I had to highlight it and Ctrl + C.

## Remaining Questions (Pending)

### Quality and Relevance of Generated Questions

**When you reviewed the questions the app generated, how did they compare to questions you would have developed yourself?**

Follow-up probes:
- Can you give me a specific example of a question that was particularly good or particularly off-target?
- Did you end up editing or customising the generated questions, and if so, how extensively?
- Were there important topics or angles that the app missed?
- How confident did you feel going into the interview with the app-generated questions?

### Facilitation Experience During the Event

**During the actual townhall interview, how did using the app change or affect the way you facilitated the conversation?**

Follow-up probes:
- Can you describe a specific moment during the interview where the app was particularly helpful or unhelpful?
- How did you navigate between the app and the actual conversation flow?
- Did the app help you ask better follow-up questions or probe more deeply, or did it constrain you?
- How did the senior leader you were interviewing respond to the questions?

### Comparison to Usual Approach

**If you were to compare this townhall interview to previous ones where you didn't use the app, what were the most significant differences you noticed?**

Follow-up probes:
- Was the overall quality of the interview better, worse, or about the same?
- Did using the app save you time in preparation, or did it take longer?
- Did you feel more or less prepared compared to your usual process?
- What specific aspects of your usual approach do you wish the app had incorporated?

### Specific Pain Points and Friction

**What were the most frustrating or difficult aspects of using the app during this experience?**

Follow-up probes:
- Can you describe a specific moment where the app got in your way or didn't behave as you expected?
- Were there features you needed that weren't available?
- What took more clicks, steps, or effort than it should have?
- Were there any technical issues or reliability concerns?

### What Worked Well

**On the flip side, what aspects of the app did you find genuinely valuable or well-designed?**

Follow-up probes:
- What made you think "I wish I'd had this for previous townhalls"?
- Were there any unexpected benefits or pleasant surprises?
- What would you definitely want to keep if the app were to be redesigned?
- What would you tell a colleague who was considering using the app?

### Vision for Future Use

**Looking beyond this one townhall experience, how do you envision using this app (or a refined version of it) in the future?**

Follow-up probes:
- Are there other contexts beyond townhalls where you could see this being useful?
- If you could wave a magic wand and add any capabilities to the app, what would they be?
- What would need to change for you to use this app regularly for all your townhall interviews?
- Who else in your organisation might benefit from a tool like this?
