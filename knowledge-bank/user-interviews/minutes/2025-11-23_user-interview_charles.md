### Preparation process for interviews

**Can you walk me through your current process for preparing to interview a
senior leader?**

- How much time does it typically take?
- What specific resources do you use?
- How do you decide what to focus on?
- What's the most challenging part?

**Notes:** identifies objective of thee discussion e.g. to share insights into
the leader's background and how to behavelooks at specific resources available
about them (internal biography) and asks them what they'd like to talk
aboutTypically takes a few hoursWants to understand what initiatives they've
been working on, what their background is (education and career -especially if
intersting), whether they're known for any contrary views or strong opinions
et.cmost time consuming is thinking of meaningful questions to ask and how to
structure them so that they flow seamlessly

### Recent interview experience where flow didn't work well

**You mentioned you had lots of detailed information but found it challenging to
bring everything together into a cohesive story. Can you tell me more about what
happened in that specific interview?**

- What specific feedback did the leader give you?
- What would have made the narrative flow better in that instance?
- When you're structuring questions, what's the hardest part?
- How do you currently decide the order of your questions?

**Notes:** He had lots of detailed information and I found it challenging to
bring everything together into a cohesive story\
The leader responded to all questions but commented afterwards that things were
jumping around quite a lot (hint)Next time, Charles would like to plan a
narrative from beginning to end and finish on drawing out adviceTpically spend
half an hour - researching and thinking of questiosn takes longer.
